            A curly fried tato madame<br>
            Was served with a platter of ham<br>
            She cried, "don't forget me!"<br>
            The pork said, "regret me!"<br>
            (The food poisoning wasn't planned)

            The first google images result and ddg images result that actually relate to ü•î s when I google tato. Everything else is just tattoos. COME ON SEARCH ENGINES, GET YOUR üí©  TOGETHER!<br>
            <img src="./entries/images/tots.png" height="400" alt="a luxurious spread of golden tater tots sit atop a plated, white napkin, delicately speckled w oil spots and fry crumbs, next to a small ramekin of perfectly swirled, fire engine red ketchup">
            <img src="./entries/images/tteokbokki.png" height="400" alt="a yellow bag of snack food on a white background, bulging obstreporously as images of thickly sliced medallions of potato and julienned french fry pieces cascade in the background. the words 'Tato Tato' are printed in a squarish, stylized font, in black lettering over a white background. a sumptuous and juicy bowl of tteokbokki rests in the lower left corner, like cantilevers awaiting installation.">

            Also found: <a href="https://tatotz.org">Association of Tour Operators</a> as first DDG result and <a href="https://www.tato.co">Tato | Run Massive IT Projects On Time and On Budget</a> as the first Google result.
