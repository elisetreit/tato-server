            A curly fried tato madame<br>
            Was served with a platter of ham<br>
            She cried, "don't forget me!"<br>
            The pork said, "regret me!"<br>
            (The food poisoning wasn't planned)

            <img src="./images/tatostickers.png" height="400" alt="a drawing of a tato, festooned with stickers in the shapes of: a book, a bee, a butterfly, two yellow five-pointed stars, and a brachiosaurus. these are the types of stickers with which you would adorn a sturdy waterbottle brought on a dayhike or a late night study session at the library. the tato is suspended in space. it soars over its ancestral livery: fifteen parallel lines in varying pastels, atop a white field. the brachiosaur looks over its shoulder; is it expectantly scanning the horizon for the foliage it so craves...or surveilling the allosaurus sticker that pursues it from the dark side of the tato?">
