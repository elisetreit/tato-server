        <h3>Fuzzy-Headed Fingerling Fallin' for Fella?</h3>
        <h4>Monday, September 1st, 2025</h4>

        <p>Dear Carlo,</p>

        <p>I am a fingerling potato, barely out of the patch. I started attending school last fall, in preparation for the paring. As you can guess, I am very scared to have a knife anywhere near my skin! But I know it's part of the coming of age ceremony, and I really want to honor my parents, so I'm going to go through with it.</p>

        <p>Anyway, when the teacher put the diagrams up on the overhead, I started shaking and my eyes started to tear up, I was so overwhelmed! Then this really nice, rugged russet that was next to me leaned over and helped calm me down. He told me he knew what it was like to feel scared like that, and how his older siblings had gone through the ceremony and they were okay after. I really appreciated his sensitivity and care.</p>

        <p>The only problem is, now I keep thinking about that russet. Like, all the time. Like, even when I don't want to be! I can't focus on anything else, and I've been spacing out in class and missing parts of the material. The russet invited me over to study, which would be helpful because I'm so far behind in my studies...but I'm afraid that will just make things worse!</p>

        <p>Meanwhile, I want to make my parents proud by being brave and doing the ceremony right. I know how important that is to them because they really care about their reputation in the community, and they want me to be accepted and respected in the community, too.</p>

        <p>Carlo, I feel so scared, confused, and overwhelmed! I don't know what to do or who to ask for advice. It's all so embarrassing! I read your column every week and trust your perspective...please please please answer my letter and tell me what I should do!!!</p>
