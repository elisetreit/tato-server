        <h1>Potatoes</h1>
        
        <p>Potatoes are, quintessentially, an earthy, wrinkled skin that is stretched out over a white, mealy mass of starch. Laden with toxins, dirt, and creepy "eyes" that stare at you no matter where you put them, one would think that the best course of action regarding these vegetables is to leave them in the ground for eternity. Instead, they're the fifth most important crop in the world, and are a staple in countless cuisines.</p>

        <p>The Andean people were among the first to pull the potato out of the ground with the intention of eating it. These original, wild variants were laden with solanine and tomatine — toxins that can't be cooked off. To remedy this, they would dip the potatoes in a mixture of clay and water before eating them. Along with being the first prototype of potatoes and gravy — a classic, delectable pairing — the clay would absorb the toxins and thus allow the potato to pass through the digestive tract without causing harm.</p>

        <p>By the time the first Spaniards arrived in Peru, the cultivation, harvest, and preparation of potatoes had developed significantly. These tubers were an absolute staple in the area, and while the Spanish were reluctant to eat them, their cultivation spread rapidly to other parts of the world.</p>

        <p>When these round, starchy relatives of the nightshade first arrived in Europe, they were viewed with universal suspicion and skepticism, and were believed to cause fever or leprosy if consumed. Besides, even if these alien crops failed to produce deadly side effects, their texture and flavor were not portrayed in a favorable light: Denis Diderot, a famous French philosopher, stated that, "no matter how you prepare it, the root is tasteless and starchy." These were just a few of the many reasons that the beloved potato failed to spread in popularity the moment it touched European soil. However, with all that said, a few people were staunch supporters of the vegetable, and with their help, the humble little potato eventually began to take root all over the continent.</p>

        <p>One such "potato pioneer" was Antoine-Augustin Parmentier, a pharmacist who had served in the Seven Years' War. The man was captured five times by the Prussians, and during his time as prisoner of war, he lived almost solely off of potatoes. When Parmentier was eventually released for the last time, he was pleased to discover that the potato, while having such a terrible reputation, had kept him alive, fit, and healthy.</p>

        <p>Parmentier immediately set off to share the miraculous, nourishing wonders of the potato in France, a nation that was particularly skeptical of the new-fangled tuber at the time. Perhaps it was Parmentier's lavish promotions — feeding all-potato meals to the unknowing upper-class, and supposedly convincing Marie Antoinette to wear potato flowers in her hair — or perhaps it was the fact that bread prices were ridiculously high and the people were starving. Either way, the potato was adopted by the French, and by the end of the 18th century, the once-hated root had suddenly become a staple all over Europe.</p>

        <p>Being incredibly productive and nourishing, the potato literally changed the world once it was adopted. What once was viewed with disgust now became the adored liberator from famine and starvation. Potato flowers, peeking out from amongst the plant's green leaves, could now be seen blanketing the ground that had once lain fallow. Children who would have died from starvation in years past now played in the fields, and would go on to have children of their own. The potato doubled Europe's food supply, and where the potato grew, the population did, also.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, of the many benefits that potatoes had brought to the land, peace was not one of them. Perhaps the most political vegetable to date, the strong opinions that had originally been born over why the potato must be rejected suddenly became a fierce battle over who had the right to grow the most potatoes. More specifically, the fight was over a precious fertilizer that could double — even triple — a potato crop, making it invaluable to the largely potato-dependent world.</p>

        <p>The valuable fertilizer in question was guano — bird guano. Essentially the dried excrement from sea birds, guano is extremely rich in phosphate, nitrogen, and potassium, making it the perfect superfood for potatoes. So when it was discovered that the Chincha Islands — a group of islands that are 13 miles off the coast of Peru — were covered in over a 150-foot layer of the stuff, everyone naturally wanted it.</p>

        <p>Peru, being closest to the islands, began to export the guano to other countries, and within 40 years, had sold over 13 million tons. Owners of large, prosperous farms raced to purchase the fertilizer, and their crops flourished tremendously when nourished with the guano from the Chincha Islands.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, success in the human race always seems to breed greed, envy, and contempt. Instead of rejoicing in their new discoveries and sharing their good fortune with others, people have the lovely habit of deciding that they need more — that they deserve more — and the discovery of the guano was no exception.</p>

        <p>Soon after other nations began to get their hands on the guano, the seed of envy was sown. They felt that they weren't being given their fair share of the dried excrement, and that Peru was charging too high a price for this valuable fertilizer. It isn't fair. That was likely the thought that coursed through the minds of farmers in other lands. Yes, the potatoes were thriving and keeping the bellies of the people filled, with or without the guano, but greed is a tricky thing. It can blind us, and cause us to want what we can't — or shouldn't — have.</p>

        <p>As arguments over the guano wore on, discontentment slowly spread from the farming community and into the general population. Newspapers were filled with opinions and accusations over Peru's monopoly of the guano. Threats of legal action and rumors of war spread like wildfire amongst the public. Was there an actual possibility that there would be war…over an island of bird poop? How far was humanity willing to fall?</p>

        <p>In the end, Spain went to war with Peru, Chile, Ecuador, and Bolivia in an attempt to seize the guano islands. The war came to be known as the Chincha Islands War, and lasted from 1865 to 1879 — in the end, Spain lost, and the Chincha Islands remain under the control of Peru to this day. Still, over the course of the war, between 300-700 lives were lost for the sake of bird poop.</p>

        <p>Other countries, such as the United States, descended upon any other islands that were covered with guano, and insisted that it was their own. So, while Peru continued to export the vast majority of the fertilizer, many nations satisfied themselves with gorging on a poor-quality alternative to the guano from the Chincha Islands.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, this overindulgence, this greed that so easily ensnares the human heart, was what brought disease — and death — to many nations. It is thought by some that the guano, carried to Europe in large ships, might have been a key contributor to helping with the spread of Phytophthora infestans. Also known as potato blight, this disease was a death sentence to millions the moment it touched Europe's soil. Sweeping across the land, it took out one crop of potatoes after another, leaving famine, starvation, and despair in its wake. Several nations were brutal victims of the blight, but few can compete with the atrocities Ireland endured.</p>

        <p>Already burdened with extreme poverty and political unrest, Ireland had enough issues to deal with without the addition of the potato blight. Although the potato was introduced to Ireland in the early 1600s, the nation, like many of its neighbors in Europe, took a while to adopt it. Still, by the 1800s, the potato had become a staple food amongst Irish farmers, and by the time the blight came to the land in 1845, 40% of the Irish population depended on the potato as their only solid food source. Take all of this into account, add the fact that all the potatoes in Ireland lacked genetic diversity — which meant they were extremely susceptible to the blight — and you've created a perfect recipe for disaster.</p>

        <p>Ireland uncovered its first harvest of black, mushy blobs in the September of 1845. While worrisome, the people remained largely unconcerned — the main harvest hadn't yet begun, and a few crops were bound to fail each year. Then October came. Instead of being greeted by the friendly sight of delicious, nourishing potatoes, almost all the farmers in Ireland were met with a homogenous pile of rot.</p>

        <p>Panic sprung up from the land as soon as the news spread; the potato, the food that kept the majority of the Irish population alive, had failed. What the people had so diligently worked for, the thing they had poured their blood, sweat, and tears into, was now nothing but a rotting heap of blackened starch.</p>

        <p>Over the years, as the potato blight steadily grew worse, the lives of the Irish did, as well. Many were weakened from malnutrition, and others succumbed to disease, their hunger making it impossible to fight off sickness. When the Great Famine finally came to an end in 1852, over one million citizens had perished, while another million had fled the shadow of death and despair that smothered the fair fields of Ireland. As a whole, the crisis led to a 20-25% decrease in the population, with the cultural climate and way of life for the Irish changing even more drastically. Despite the years that have passed since the disaster, Ireland has yet to recover.</p>

        <p>Unlike the Irish (and many others, for the matter), my relationship with the potato has always been a happy one, and every time I catch a whiff of its rich, earthy scent, I am swept back to childhood memories where I felt warm; comfortable; safe — three things that I seldom experienced all at the same moment.</p>

        <p>Some of my earliest — and fondest — memories revolved around the potato. While the rest of my family bustled around in the kitchen, rolling dough, slicing vegetables, and stirring warm, bubbling pots of stew, I was content to sit on the floor and scrape away the potato's earthy skin, finding simple, innocent delight each time I uncovered the delicate white flesh that was hidden beneath.</p>

        <p>However, as fascinating as it was to peel potatoes, my favorite part was not preparing the tuber, but instead devouring the fruits of my (and my family's) labor. The potato is so versatile in the ways you can prepare it, and no matter what the end result was, my mouth was always left watering for more. On cold autumn evenings, after running through the shadowy trees and chasing wind-tossed leaves, I craved to feel the delightfully warm, crispy skin of a roasted potato melting into pillowy softness on the top of my tongue. On other occasions, a beautiful, fluffy bowl of mashed potatoes, tinted yellow with rich butter, would greet me on the kitchen table.</p>

        <p>Yet of all the merits potatoes have brought to my life, the one I appreciated the most was the peace it brought to my family's table. Perhaps ironic, considering its history, but for my family, no friction, politics, or wars arose over the delicious food that so often graced our meals. Our love for potatoes was one of the few things that united us: when we ate potatoes, there were no siblings weeping over eating sauerkraut. There were no groans and complaints over having the same meal for the fifth time that week. There was little bickering, unless it involved who had a larger portion of smashed potatoes. Simply put, the potato brought us — and still brings us — together.</p>

        <p>For me, it's difficult to be angry when you have potatoes on your plate. For others, however, it is a source of hatred and pure malice. How is it that the potato can divide us so greatly? How is it that the potato, packed with so many life-sustaining nutrients, has shaped humanity in such a way that since its introduction a few centuries ago, the global population has grown from less than one billion to more than seven billion? How is it possible that humanity — the very people who boast over victorious battles, architectural marvels, and grand achievements — be brought to their knees by a small, humble root that grows underground? What does that say about you? About me? About all of humanity?</p>

        <p>Potatoes are, quintessentially, an earthy, wrinkled skin that is stretched out over a white, mealy mass of starch. But they are also powerful. They are life-changing. And regardless of what we may think, they are not just humble little vegetables. For humanity, they are humbling, and in this day and age, the world could use a little more humility.</p>
